# Patcher

## How to Use the Project

### 1. Create a Project
Start by creating a new project.  
A project represents the application or software for which you want to manage patch notes.

---

### 2. Create a Version
Once the project is created, you must add at least one version (for example: `1.0.0`, `1.2.3`, etc.).

A version represents a specific release of your project.

---

### 3. Select a Version
If multiple versions exist, select the version you want to work on.  
All patch notes you create will be associated with the currently selected version.

---

### 4. Add Patch Notes
After selecting a version, you can start adding patch notes such as:
- **Fixes**
- **Features**
- **Additions**
- Other improvements

Each patch note is categorized to keep your changelog clean and well-structured.

---

### 5. Export Patch Notes
When your patch notes are ready, you can export them easily.

The application allows you to export your patch notes automatically (for example in **Markdown** format), making them ready to be shared on:
- GitHub
- Websites
- App stores
- Documentation pages

No manual formatting is required — everything is generated for you.
